# Question 1(i)
# Write a Python program to find the distance between two coordinate points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
x1 = float(input("Enter the value of x1  :"))
y1 = float(input("Enter the value of y1   :"))
x2 = float(input("enter the value of x2   :"))
y2 = float(input("enter the value of y2    :"))
import math as sqrt
distance = sqrt((x2-x1)**2 +(y2-y1)**2)

# Question 1(ii)
# Write a Python program to find maximum between three numbers.
